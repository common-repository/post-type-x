Catalog plugin with fully customizable responsive design, search and categories. Best for product catalog and services or portfolio presentation.

== Description ==

Product Catalog Simple is a free WordPress plugin that helps you to manage and display your X catalog. Replace the X with whatever you need to catalog e.g. flowers, houses, boats, mixed products, services, portfolio. 

__[Live Demo](http://demo.implecode.com?cam=wordpress-org-catalog-page&key=x-demo-link)__

= Built with WordPress =

Product Catalog Simple is build with WordPress functions to provide maximum compatibility with other plugins. Custom post types and custom taxonomies are used for items and categories.

= Total output control =
The admin has complete control on the plugin output with fully customisable templates and dozens of shortcodes.

The catalog items can be categorized with hierarchical categories.

Product Catalog Simple as full of WordPress hooks is extremely customizable and extensible.

= User Friendly Design =

Product Catalog Simple has three different, fully responsive product listing styles. The individual item page is simple but complete with 100% responsive design.

= Modularity Philosophy =

You will never need to do any workaround to disable not needed functionality. Product Catalog Simple is built to be extended.

= Customizable dashboard =

= Display Items with a Shortcode =

Use the shortcode to show items whenever needed on the website. Just paste on any page: [show_products] and watch all items in place of the shortcode.

To show items from just one category, use: [show_products category="2"] where 2 is category ID (it's possible to display several categories by inserting comma separated IDs). 

To display items by IDs, use: [show_products product="5"], where 5 is item ID.

= Display Categories with a Shortcode =

You can use [show_categories] shortcode to show the item categories on home page or any other WordPress page.

= Smart Widgets =

Product Catalog Simple comes with two widgets: 

__1. Item Categories__ - show all item categories in CSS customisable list. The widget has also several customisation settings.

__2. Item Search__ - generates a search form that allows to search the items in the catalog.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the difference between Product Catalog Simple and eCommerce Product Catalog? =

Product Catalog Simple is a simple and extensible base on which you can built your deeply customized product catalog, services list, portfolio etc. It has only basic features. While developing eCommerce Product Catalog we realized that many users are trying to disable some functionality because they don't need it. That's why we came up with Product Catalog Simple which can be extended but it doesn't force any functionality.

Product Catalog Simple and eCommerce Product Catalog share the same base so you can switch between them without loosing configuration, products and categories.

== Screenshots ==

The screenshots below show the example usage of Product Catalog Simple as a product catalog:

1. Product Catalog Simple main listing with categories and items enabled. The "Modern Grid" listing design is used here.
2. Product Catalog Simple main listing with categories and items enabled. The "Classic List" listing design is used here.
3. Product Catalog Simple main listing with categories and items enabled. The "Classic Grid" listing design is used here.
4. Simple product page with additional images in description
5. Main catalog settings screen
6. Categories, SEO and breadcrumbs settings


== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.5 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of impleCode Product Catalog Simple, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Product Catalog Simple” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found Product Catalog Simple plugin you can view details about it such as the the rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you’re sure you want to install the plugin. Click yes and WordPress will automatically complete the installation.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our item catalog plugin and uploading it to your web-server via your favourite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation’s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

= Upgrading =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the plugin pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.
